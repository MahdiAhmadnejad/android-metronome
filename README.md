## Metronome
android-kotlin-metronome is a simple and lightweight (only 2.7MB for production build) metronome 
app that is still fully featured and well designed.
I used this project mainly to learn Kotlin and Android app development.

Other than that, I did not use any external libraries over what the Android SDK, Kotlin and java 
provide.
